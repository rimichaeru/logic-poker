# logic-poker
A condensed, yet critically different, version of poker based on bet sizing judgement.

Logic poker is a type of speed poker with an emphasis on bet-sizing.

How to play:
1. View your hand and 3 other players' hands - but you do not know which opponent has what cards!
2. Based on this information and the generated ante, make a bet.
3. Win!

Expect to lose a lot. The aim of the game is **not to win every hand** but to accumulate as many coins as possible over numerous games.
This can be achieved by betting according to your hand's strength and the coin ante already in the pot! Just like in regular poker. 
If you become good at bet sizing in this way then you should be able to, technically, always win after many rounds!

Tip: Remember, there's a baseline 1/4 chance to win!

Extra Features:
 - Round to the near 10.
 - Low/Mid/High base ante to change the pace of the game.
