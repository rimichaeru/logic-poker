# logic-poker
### A condensed, yet critically different, version of poker based on bet sizing judgement.
### Logic poker is a type of speed poker with an emphasis on bet-sizing.

#### How to play:
1. View your hand and 3 other players' hands - but you do not know which opponent has what cards!
2. Based on this information and the generated ante, make a bet.
3. Win!
 
You may lose a lot. The aim of the game is **not to win every hand** but to accumulate as many coins as possible over numerous games.
This can be achieved by betting according to your hand's strength and the coin ante already in the pot! Just like in regular poker. 
If you become good at bet sizing in this way then you should be able to, technically, always win after many rounds!

You are not able to bet more than 4 times the pot, this prevents a sudden large win in the case of very good cards - the aim is to be consistent, and is also inline with max-bet poker formats!
Tip: Remember, there's a baseline 1/4 chance to win!

#### Extra Features:
 - Round to the nearest 10
 - Low/Mid/High base ante to change the pace of the game
 - Restart game
 - Fixed betting buttons for ease of use
